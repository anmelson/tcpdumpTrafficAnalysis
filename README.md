# Analyzing Traffic with Linux tcpdump

Welcome to my project on packet analysis using tcpdump. Here, you'll find insights, procedures, and the knowledge I've gathered during this hands-on exploration.

## Description

This was a simple project with the purpose of learning the different arguments available for tcpdump, using them to capture network packets, and saving them in a pcap file for analysis with Wireshark or tcpdump itself.

## Languages and Utilities Used

- **tcpdump**
- **Wireshark**

## Arguments Explored

- **-c**
- **-w**
- **-#**
- **-XX**
- **-tttt**
- **-G**
- **-C**
- **-D**
- **-i**
- **host**
- **port**

## Conclusion

Through this project, I've deepened my understanding of packet analysis using tcpdump and Wireshark. For those interested in diving deeper into tcpdump, refer to the [official documentation](https://www.tcpdump.org/manpages/tcpdump.1.html).
